## Skate Sesh

Welcome to the Skate Sesh web application! This is a demo app created using Sinatra and ActiveRecord. Skate Sesh is an app for roller skaters(for now) to be able to post ones skate progression. In my personal experience I have a hard time focusing on one trick at a time, and find myself trying multiple tricks in one session rather than focusing on one and fully accomplishing and learning the trick. This app will help skaters track their progress, and be able to log what was learned during that skate session.
